THE GAME

The objective of the game is to defend your cities and missile bases, The enemy fires interplanetary ballistic missiles (MBI) and cruise missiles, both aim to destroy your cities and military bases. There are 2 types of cruise missiles: dumb cruise missiles (which fall in a straight line) and smart cruise missiles, which will try to evade your anti-ballistic missiles (MABs).

The enemy attacks in a series of waves that can vary in the number of IBMs that attack. Each wave of missiles moves faster than the previous wave. The faster the wave, the more difficult it is to defend the cities. For this reason, the faster the wave, the higher the score will be earned.

With each wave, you have 30 MABs to defend yourself, 10 in each of the silos, which are located at the bottom of the screen, left, center and right. Once you've shot all 30 MABs, you'll be defenseless until a new wave starts.

Every time a MAB reaches its destination or hits an enemy missile, an explosion occurs. The shock wave from this explosion can cause other cruise or interplanetary ballistic missiles in the impact zone to be destroyed as well. If the MAB explosion does not reach the head of the missile, it will continue on its trajectory, only the wake it leaves behind will be affected.
You must take into account that there is a threshold (imaginary horizontal line) on the playing field, below which you will not be able to fire missiles. In this way, silos and cities are protected from self-destruction.

If you manage to survive the wave, you will go to the next level, if you fail to survive the wave, you will have just another chance to defend yourself again.

The game ends when all cities are destroyed.

SCORE

You will earn points when you destroy interplanetary ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. You can also add points for unused anti-ballistic missiles and cities saved. Since each wave of IBMs moves faster, the score earned will also be higher. For example, waves 9 and 10 are worth 5 times the original score.
